# Sparse-Matrix-Vector-Multiplication
A high performance computing project which looks at the performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication with cpu, cuda and mpi implementations.

Output folder contains output for all matrix sizes for all implementations.

Each implementation has its own folder with makefiles and .sh files.

The Report is in the PDF.
